Because when we try to change some value in a string, the reference to original value is lost and in a way,
a new string is created. This solves a big problem, For eg:
s1= 'old value'
s2= s1
s2= 'new value'

now since s2 and s1 earlier referenced to same value, if it would have been mutable,
a change in s2 would have also meant a change in s1. This is not very nice. Therefore strings are immutable

Moreover:
The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it. The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.
